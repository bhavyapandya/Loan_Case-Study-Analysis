# Loan_Case-Study-Analysis


Introduction
This case study aims to identify patterns that indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments. The study's goal is to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to take actions such as denying loans, reducing the amount of loan, or lending to risky applicants at a higher interest rate. The ultimate goal is to ensure that consumers who are capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

Methodology and Tools
The project utilizes Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize the data. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and consists of over 2.2 million observations and 145 features. The data was preprocessed by handling missing values, converting data types, and filtering out irrelevant features.

Findings
The project's findings include patterns, trends, and correlations found in the data related to the loan approval process. The analysis found that factors such as debt-to-income ratio, credit score, and loan amount were significant predictors of loan approval. Additionally, the project discovered that loan approvals varied significantly based on geographic location and loan purpose.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the Loan Case Study demonstrates the importance of EDA in identifying patterns and trends in loan application data. The study's findings can inform loan approval decisions and improve the lending process's accuracy and efficiency. Future work could include further analysis of loan approval factors and exploration of machine learning techniques to improve loan approval accuracy.
